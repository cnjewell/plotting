clean up messy data
pull apart levels from datetime


AT HOME
*******
generate a small test dataset with [datetime, levels]
find how to grab records by
	week, hour, day

query data set

QUESTIONS AND GOALS
*******************
plot worker levels across a day
plot average worker levels across many days

find variability in worker demand
find peak hours
find weekly variations in demand
measure worker valleys and spikes

gauge minimum required workers to trigger provisioner

The problem is how fast can we get the next 18+ workers up and running once some critical threshold point has been reached? Davidson says approx 5-8mins for the instance to launch and load the neural net into memory. So if worker levels have been declining at a rate that is faster than...

No, need to stop overthinking this. 

Simple, straightforward solution:
Once worker levels are below 10, launch an instance.
  There should be a blocking cooldown state for this trigger
If we are at peak hours, make sure we have 3 instances available.
Just hardcode a schedule for now. 
Scheduled worker launches works well with the structure we have already.

So, for now I can just crunch numbers and visualize levels.

********************
Take a dataset where you have consecutive datatimes and levels data
Grab just the records where the data is between two dates
Plot the levels across time for that slice of records

MOCKUP
mess > csv > sql3 > query > plot

+ convert the messy data to a csv 
+ take each line of the csv and iteratively place the data into a sql3 db
+ devise queries that can select by datetime, day, hour, etc.
+ take query returns and format into plottable data structures
